# Confluence Documentation Index

This folder mirrors the Confluence space layout for CaC-IAM. Import the Markdown directly or copy sections into pages.

## Core pages
- `application-pattern.md`: Plan/apply patterns, ordering rules, and persistence notes.  
- `testing-steps.md`: Commands for unit runs, plan/apply smoke tests, and verification.  
- `diagrams-workflow.md`: How to use and export Mermaid diagrams.

## Category references
- `categories/policy.md`  
- `categories/role.md`  
- `categories/user.md`

## Knowledge share
- `knowledge-share/resources.md`: Links and files to share during onboarding.  
- `knowledge-share/sessions.md`: Suggested agendas and follow-ups.

## Usage tip
Attach PNG exports from `diagrams/` alongside the Markdown when publishing to Confluence, and link to the deeper specs under `spec/` for contributors who want implementation details.
